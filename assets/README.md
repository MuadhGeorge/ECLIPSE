# Assets Directory

This directory contains visual assets for the ECLIPSE game.

## Placeholder Files

The following files are referenced in the main README:

- `gameplay.gif` - Animated gameplay demonstration (300-500 KB recommended)
- `menu.png` - Main menu screenshot (1920x1080 or similar)
- `gameplay.png` - In-game screenshot showing puzzle (1920x1080 or similar)
- `stats.png` - Statistics screen screenshot (1920x1080 or similar)

## Creating Assets

### Gameplay GIF

Capture a short gameplay session (10-15 seconds) showing:
- Click interaction to place Sun/Moon
- Hints being used
- Undo/redo
- Puzzle completion

Tools:
- **Windows**: ScreenToGif, ShareX
- **macOS**: Kap, LICEcap
- **Linux**: Peek, SimpleScreenRecorder + ffmpeg

### Screenshots

Capture clean screenshots at key moments:
1. **Main menu**: Show title, play button, current streak
2. **Gameplay**: Show puzzle with colored regions, some filled cells, hints panel
3. **Stats**: Show statistics screen with streak, solve time, etc.

## Guidelines

- **File size**: Keep GIF under 5 MB, PNGs under 2 MB each
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- **Format**: PNG for screenshots, GIF for animations
- **Content**: Show actual game UI, avoid placeholder text

## Current Status

🎨 **Placeholder assets needed** - Game is fully functional, visual assets pending.

Once assets are created, they will automatically appear in the README!
