# ✅ Repository is NOW Recruiter-Ready

## All Issues Fixed and Pushed to GitHub

### Fixed Issues
1. ✅ **vcpkg.json**: Changed `yourusername/eclipse` → `MuadhGeorge/ECLIPSE`
2. ✅ **README.md**: Already had correct URLs (`MuadhGeorge/ECLIPSE` and `cd ECLIPSE`)
3. ✅ **All commands**: Verified no weird spaces or broken formatting
4. ✅ **Binary names**: All correctly reference `eclipse_app`, not "ECLIPSE" binary
